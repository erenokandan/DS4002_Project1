# DS4002_Project1
UVA DS 4002 Spring 2024 Group 13 Project 1 Files
## Software and Platform Selection
### Software Selection
- In this project, we have decided to use Python software to manipulate data and R for certain graphs
### Additional Packages Utilized
- Pandas package in python was used to manipulate and create data
- Vader sentimental analysis package was used to analyze reviews made by McDonald's patrons
- Plotly Express and plotly.graph_objects Package was used to create various plots in Python
- No additional packages need to be installed on R

### Platform 
Both Mac and Wondiws machines were used during the process, project will replicable in both environments

## Map of the Documentation
### There are 6 main files and some of them include subfolders within them 
#### Data, Output, Scripts, License, References, and Readme.md are the main folders
- Data file includes original dataset, McDonalds_reviews.csv is the original dataset and Mcdonalds_clean.csv is the cleanded dataset
- Output file includes Figure 1.png, Figure 2.png, Figure 3.png, Figure 4.png, and Figure 5.png outputs that were generated for data exploration
- Scripts file includes DS4002_Project1.ipynb is the master script file, and DS Spring 24 Project1.R is data visualization component
- References, Readme.md, and License do not include subfolders within them

## Reproducing Results
To replicate results of this study, first step will downloading the original dataset from the Data folder in github, McDonalds_reviews.csv.
After donwloading the original dataset, next step will be running the master script, where data is cleaned, Vader package is ran, and cleaned data is downloaded in the current working directionary within your machine. Cleaned dataset, Mcdonalds_clean.csv, can also be used for data visualization done in R or the one genrated withion the master script.
